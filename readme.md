# 3DFace FID Pipeline

A consolidated pipeline for calculating Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores between enhanced, raw, and reference face datasets. This tool combines face alignment, reference subset selection, and FID calculation into a single streamlined workflow.

## Features

* **Face Alignment**: Automatically aligns all face images to CelebA format (178x218) using facial landmarks

* **Reference Subset Selection**: Optionally selects optimal reference images based on k-nearest neighbors with enhanced dataset

* **FID Calculation**: Computes FID scores between reference and both enhanced/raw datasets

* **Batch Processing**: Efficient GPU-accelerated processing with configurable batch sizes

* **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and error handling

## Pipeline Steps

### 1\. Face Alignment

* Converts all images to JPEG format

* Detects facial landmarks using face_recognition library

* Aligns and crops faces to CelebA format (178x218 pixels)

* Saves aligned images with `_aligned` suffix

### 2\. Reference Subset Selection (Optional)

* Extracts InceptionV3 features from reference and enhanced datasets

* Finds k-nearest neighbors between reference and enhanced images

* Selects optimal reference subset for fair comparison

* Can be skipped with `--no-subset-selection` flag

### 3\. FID Calculation

* Computes FID scores between reference and enhanced datasets

* Computes FID scores between reference and raw datasets

* Reports improvement (difference between raw and enhanced FID)

## Preprocessing Steps

### Image Alignment Process

1. **Format Conversion**:

  * All input images are first converted to JPEG format

  * Images with transparency (RGBA) have white background applied

  * All images are converted to RGB color mode

2. **Face Detection and Landmark Extraction**:

  * Face landmarks are detected using the face_recognition library

  * Key facial points including eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows are identified

  * If no face is detected, the image is skipped

3. **Geometric Alignment**:

  * Eye centers are calculated by averaging left and right eye landmark points

  * Image is rotated to make eyes horizontal (based on angle between eyes)

  * Eyes center is positioned at approximately 51% from the top of the image

4. **Scaling and Cropping**:

  * Target eye distance is set to 80 pixels (for 178x218 output)

  * Scale factor is calculated based on original eye distance

  * Image is cropped to maintain consistent facial proportions

  * If crop extends beyond image bounds, padding is applied

5. **Resizing**:

  * Final image is resized to target dimensions (default: 178x218 pixels)

  * LANCZOS resampling is used for high-quality resizing

### Reference Subset Selection Process

1. **Feature Extraction**:

  * InceptionV3 model is loaded with pretrained weights

  * Images are loaded in batches and processed through the model

  * 2048-dimensional feature vectors are extracted from each image

2. **Normalization**:

  * Each image is normalized by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation

  * Normalization is applied per-image (not across dataset)

3. **Nearest Neighbor Selection**:

  * Pairwise distances are calculated between reference and enhanced image features

  * For each reference image, the k-th nearest enhanced image is identified

  * Unique set of selected enhanced images is collected

  * Selected images are copied to a new directory for FID calculation

### FID Calculation Process

1. **Feature Extraction**:

  * Images are loaded in batches and converted to PyTorch tensors

  * Each image is normalized by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation

  * Images are processed through InceptionV3 model to extract features

  * Features are pooled to 2048-dimensional vectors

2. **Statistical Calculation**:

  * Mean vector (μ) is calculated across all image features in each dataset

  * Covariance matrix (Σ) is calculated for each dataset

  * Frechet distance is computed using the formula:\
    d² = ||μ₁ - μ₂||² + Tr(Σ₁ + Σ₂ - 2√(Σ₁Σ₂))

3. **Numerical Stability**:

  * Small epsilon (1e-6) is added to covariance matrices if needed

  * Complex components are handled by taking real part if negligible

  * Matrix square root is computed using scipy's linalg.sqrtm

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA out of memory**: Reduce `--batch-size` parameter

2. **Face detection fails**: Ensure images contain clear, frontal faces

3. **dlib installation fails**: Install CMake and build tools

4. **Slow processing**: Use GPU with `--device cuda:0` and increase `--num-workers`

### Performance Tips

* Use GPU acceleration when available

* Increase batch size for better GPU utilization

* Use SSD storage for faster I/O

* Adjust number of workers based on CPU cores
